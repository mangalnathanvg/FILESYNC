# FILESYNC(First project after I learnt the basics of HTML,CSS and PHP)
A basic File Syncronization application

In this application, the user enters the folder or drive address (eg. C:/Program files/....) of two different folders or drives.

Once the user clicks submit, 2 lists will be generated. 

The first list comprises of file names and folder names which are present in the 1st folder location but not in the 2nd folder location.

The second list comprises of file names and folder names which are present in the 2nd folder location but not in the 1st folder location.

To run this app, you will need XAMPP web server to parse PHP Files.

Once XAMPP is running, navigate to mainview.html

Note: This project was solely created for the purpose of learning HTML, CSS and PHP. Suggestions are always welcome and shall be appreciated.
