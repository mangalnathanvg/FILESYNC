<h1> What is File Sync?</h1>
<p>File sync is a means to synchronize two directories so that both shall have the same contents. The original directory is the reference directory which we use to compare with a mirror directory so that the mirror directory shall have the same contents as that of the original directory.</p>
<h1>About this Webapp</h1>
<p>The basic version of FILESYNC has been implemented in this web application. This app does not synchronize two directories directly. Instead it gives us info for manual synchronization.</p>
